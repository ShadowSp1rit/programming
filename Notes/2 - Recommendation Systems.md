# Recommendation Systems

##  Popularity and "Likes" 

This type of paradigm (The way that we look at something) makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing

One prime example of this, is the like button, heart in instagram. When you click on that heart button, instagram records it somewhere along with other data like demographic and psychographic information. With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and services that you like.

We implemented the popularity likes paradigm with our Favourite Bubble Tea activity.

## N-Point Rating System

N-point rating systems are used by many service3s particularly Jeff Bezos's baby, Amazon

This paradigm provides more granular information. 
Buyers are asked to rate a product on a five star scale. All the ratings are put together to formulate into five stars.
