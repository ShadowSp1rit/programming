# Write a function called stars()

# It then returns a string of stars with the same length as the argument

def row_of_stars(num_stars: int) -> None:
    """Calculates the number of stars.
    Results are in one line
    
    Params:
    
    sidelength - length of one row of the square"""

    stars("*")
    
    return
print("How many stars would you like?")
stars =input()
print(f"{row_of_stars}")

# Question 2

# Write a function that TAKES THREE NUMBERS

# it should RETURN THE BIGGEST of the three numbers

def biggest_of_three(numbers: float) -> None:
    """Calculates the highest number out of three inputs.
    Result is the highest number.
    
    Params:
    
    numbers - integers"""

    biggest = numbers <= numbers

    return

    print(f"The highest number is {biggest_of_three}")
