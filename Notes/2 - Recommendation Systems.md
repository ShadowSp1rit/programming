# Recommendation Systems

##  Popularity and "Likes" 

This type of paradigm (The way that we look at something) makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing

One prime example of this, is the like button, heart in instagram. When you click on that heart button, instagram records it somewhere along with other data like demographic and psychographic information. With this information, they might suggest to other users similar to you, products and services that you like.

We implemented the popularity likes paradigm with our Favourite Bubble Tea activity.

## N-Point Rating System

N-point rating systems are used by many services particularly Jeff Bezos's baby, Amazon

This paradigm provides more granular information. 
Buyers are asked to rate a product on a five star scale. All the ratings are put together to formulate into five stars.

## Similarity Score

Amazon, Meta, TikTok, Netflix, all use similarity scores to help drive and keep users on their platforms.

>Example
> Amazon

> Ubial likes "nintendo switch" etc
> Ben also likes "nintendo switch" etc
> Fido likes "lego" "chewtoys" "fuzzy slippers"

Similarity scores, indicate how similar two people are to each other, so you can say that ben and ubial have the same similarity score of 2 (Both likes similar things) Ubial and fido dont have a similarity score, but ben and fido have 1 similarity point.
