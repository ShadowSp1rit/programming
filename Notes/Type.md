In python, data can be grouped in categories called types

| Name        | Example         |
| ---             | ---                  |
| string or `str` | `"Hello world!"` |
| `list`         | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` |
| boolean or bool   | `True False` |
| integer or `int`    | `1, -10, 1205`    |
| float.                  | `1.2 -4321.21 1.0.`     |


An example showing the use of these names is below

```python
favoruite_food = "bibimbap"
my_age = 16
my_age_float = 16.0
# my_age_float is a type of float
```

## Converting Types

There are some special functions built into python that helps to convert data from one type to another. 

```python
intro_string = "My age is"
my_age = 16

# Recall
"My name is" + "Jim" # "My name isJim
"My name is" + " " + "Jim" # "My name is JIm"
intro_string + my_age # This is going to break
```
