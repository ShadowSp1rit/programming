In Python, lists are a collection of items
We store values inside of lists
The values of the items can be of different [[Type]]
*Order Matters* in a list

# Creating a List
To make a list, we use brackets \[\] to surround our list
We separate the individual items with commas (,)

```Python
some_list = ["Jimmy", "Sara", "Frederique"]
```

# Access Elements in the List
We can access the individual things from lists using **bracket notation**
in the example below, we will use bracket notation to access "Sara"

```python
some_list[1] # "Sara"
some_list[0] # "Jimmy"
some_list[2] # "Frederique"
some_list[-1] # "Frederique" counts from the end
some_list[-2] # "Sara"
```

Inside the brackets, we give the "index" of the item we want 
Python uses 0-index counting, which means we count starting at 0
